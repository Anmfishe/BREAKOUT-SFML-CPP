Breakout Project for GAME 230

To play the game, download FinalBuild.zip. It's 25 MB but I promise it's worth it.

Went for the bonus objectives of:

New Type of Brick (invis)

Two player paddles (Hit p to spawn it, use A and D to move)

Also:

Hit left alt to switch levels. They can play rather long.
